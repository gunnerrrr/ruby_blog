ActionController::UnknownFormat (TagsController#show is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

The OOP or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-object-oriented-programming-online-courses.html\">Object Oriented programming</a>&nbsp;is a useful skill because it handles the complexity of a real-world application quite well. It&#39;s easier to think in terms of class and objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Java has a rich API, and you can do a lot more with Java including graphics, sound and most likely writing small games like Tic Tac Toe, Tetris, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that you cannot do that with other languages, you often need to download and install different modules and library, which is a tough job for a starter. When you install&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/11/top-5-free-java-courses-for-beginners.html#axzz5bvMCbE00\">Java</a>, most of these feature comes as part of the installation only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) Java has&nbsp;<strong>strong community support</strong>, no matter what kind of questions, doubt, or issue you have, Google can find answers for you. If not Google, then StackOverflow, Java forums and a lot of other communities are there to help you out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is really the single biggest reason I suggest beginners&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/03/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-to-code.html\">learn to code using Java</a>&nbsp;because when you are starting to learn to program you will face many different kinds of issues to understand for both programming fundamentals and Java.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because there are millions of Java developers around and a big community is there to support, most likely you will find answers quickly without getting frustrated and disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) Java is a&nbsp;<strong><em>strongly typed language</em></strong>, which catches many newbie mistakes. Also valid, to a lesser extent, for static typing. This is another reason I suggest beginners&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/java-vs-python-which-programming-language-to-learn-first.html\">learn Java first then Python</a>&nbsp;because Python is dynamic typing language, you don&#39;t need to define types which make learning confusing a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6) Java comes with in-built Garbage collection, which is a big plus for a complete beginner. Dealing with memory management is a big thing at the start of learning programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are some of the reasons why I think beginners should learn Java first than any other language. I may be biased because I am a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/10-tips-to-become-better-java-developer.html#axzz5jwmmAbXI\">Java programmer</a>, but I also know&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/10-free-python-programming-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-online-38312f3b9912\">Python</a>, and I have also done professional programming in C and C++. From that experience, I can say that Java is undoubtedly one of the&nbsp;<em>best programming languages for beginners</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have already made up your mind to learn Java, then you can join&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F\"><strong>The Complete Java Masterclass</strong></a>&nbsp;to start your journey into the beautiful world of Java.

Here's Why\r\n", "body"=>"<p>If you&#39;re a self-taught developer or Bootcamp student trying to get a job in tech can be hard. It&#39;s a lot of people aiming for the same goal of becoming a developer. A lot of times your resumes get ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s because:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>resumes are boring</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best things I did was speak at meetups BEFORE I had my first dev job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking at meetups puts you in front of professional developers, but in this situation, you&#39;re the star, you&#39;re the expert. That&#39;s a different position to be in than when you&#39;re just blindly submitting apps. You now have a face with your name and a personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s basically a cheat code to stand out in a sea of aspiring devs because not a lot of people like to speak in public and meetups are ALWAYS looking for speakers. You&#39;re giving them one less thing they have to worry about.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Do You Talk About?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some you might be thinking what can you talk about you&#39;re a noob speaking to professionals, There are two approaches you can take. I took both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, you can talk about new and hot technologies or tools. I gave a talk on a new framework called Svelte at a JavaScript Meetup. Not a lot of people knew about it and I was able to add something new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was asked questions that I didn&#39;t know the answer to.

This is a concept that often causes new developers to stumble when first learning JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIn this article we’ll look at a few examples to better understand how variables are treated and what the difference is between “reference” and “value”.", "body"=>"<h2>Passing Primitives</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Primitive data types in JavaScript are things like&nbsp;<code>number</code>,&nbsp;<code>string</code>,&nbsp;<code>boolean</code>, or&nbsp;<code>undefined</code>. There are other primitives, but those are the most common ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Primitives are passed by value.</strong>&nbsp;To understand what that means, let&rsquo;s look at a simple example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const myNumber = 10;\r\n\r\nconst addOne = x =&gt; x + 1;\r\n\r\nconst anotherNumber = addOne(myNumber);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(myNumber);\r\nconsole.log(anotherNumber);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example we have a variable&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;which has the value&nbsp;<code>10</code>. We have a function&nbsp;<code>addOne</code>&nbsp;that takes an argument and returns the argument plus&nbsp;<code>1</code>. Then we call the&nbsp;<code>addOne</code>&nbsp;function using the&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;variable as the argument and save the result to another variable called&nbsp;<code>anotherNumber</code>. Finally, we log to the console the values of both of our variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question is: what gets logged?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>10</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>11</code>, you are correct. Because numbers are passed by value, the value of&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;is passed to the function, but when the number is incremented, the&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;variable is unaffected.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Comparing Primitives</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we know that primitives are passed by value. But what about when they&rsquo;re compared? To answer that, let&rsquo;s look at another example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const x = 5;\r\nconst y = 5;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(x === y);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>We have two variables,&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>, both of which have the value&nbsp;<code>5</code>. When we log to the console a check for strict equality, what do we get?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>true</code>, you are correct. This is because&nbsp;<strong>primitives are compared by value</strong>&nbsp;too, and&nbsp;<code>5</code>&nbsp;is equal to&nbsp;<code>5</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Passing Objects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what about data types that are not primitives in JavaScript? For example,&nbsp;<code>objects</code>&nbsp;are not primitives, and neither are&nbsp;<code>arrays</code>&nbsp;(which are really just objects, secretly).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Objects are passed by reference.</strong>&nbsp;To understand what that means, let&rsquo;s look at a simple example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const someNumbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\n\r\nconst addNumberToArray = arr =&gt; {\r\n  arr.push(100);\r\n  return arr;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst otherNumbers = addNumberToArray(someNumbers);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(otherNumbers);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example we have a variable&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;which is an array that contains three elements. We have a function&nbsp;<code>addNumberToArray</code>&nbsp;that takes an argument (an array), pushes the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;into the array, and then returns the array. Then we call the&nbsp;<code>addNumberToArray</code>&nbsp;function using the&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;variable as the argument and save the result to another variable called&nbsp;<code>otherNumbers</code>. Finally, we log to the console the values of both of our variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question is: what gets logged?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>, you are correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh no! We&rsquo;ve inadvertently modified our input array that we passed to the function!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because objects are passed by reference, the reference to&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;is passed to the function. So, when the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;is pushed to the array, that value is being pushed into the same array that&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;represents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted to be sure not to modify the original array in a function like this, it would be necessary to push the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;into a copy of the input array using the&nbsp;<code>concat</code>&nbsp;method or the ES6&nbsp;<code>spread</code>&nbsp;operator. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const someNumbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\nconst addNumberToArray = arr =&gt; [...arr, 100];\r\nconst otherNumbers = addNumberToArray(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(otherNumbers);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now when we log those two variables to the console, we&rsquo;ll see&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>&nbsp;get logged. Much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Comparing Objects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we know that objects are passed by reference. But what about when they&rsquo;re compared? To answer that, let&rsquo;s look at another example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const object1 = { someKey: &#39;someValue&#39; }\r\nconst object2 = { someKey: &#39;someValue&#39; }</span></code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">\r\nconsole.log(object1 === object2);</span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>We have two variables,&nbsp;<code>object1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>object2</code>, both of which are an object with only one property. The key is&nbsp;<code>someKey</code>, and the value is&nbsp;<code>someValue</code>. When we log to the console a check for strict equality, what do we get?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>false</code>, you are correct. This is because&nbsp;<strong>objects are compared by reference</strong>&nbsp;too. Even though these two objects are the same in value, they are not the same object. These are two separate objects held in two separate variables, so their references are different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted a quick sanity check, you could also check if each object is equal to itself, like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">console.log(object1 === object1);\r\nconsole.log(object2 === object2);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of these logs to the console will be&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;since in each case you are comparing an object to itself, which is the same reference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you really wanted to check if&nbsp;<code>object1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>object2</code>&nbsp;had the same keys and values, you&rsquo;d need to write a utility method that would loop over the objects&rsquo; keys and values and make sure that they are all identical. Or, you could use a helper method from a library like&nbsp;<code>lodash</code>&nbsp;which implements this functionality for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Primitives are passed and compared by value. Objects are passed and compared by reference. Understanding the difference will save you a lot of headaches debugging your code!</p>\r\n", "post_tags"=>"#javascript, #beginners, #webdev"}, "commit"=>"Save"}

There are other primitives, but those are the most common ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Primitives are passed by value.</strong>&nbsp;To understand what that means, let&rsquo;s look at a simple example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const myNumber = 10;\r\n\r\nconst addOne = x =&gt; x + 1;\r\n\r\nconst anotherNumber = addOne(myNumber);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(myNumber);\r\nconsole.log(anotherNumber);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example we have a variable&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;which has the value&nbsp;<code>10</code>. We have a function&nbsp;<code>addOne</code>&nbsp;that takes an argument and returns the argument plus&nbsp;<code>1</code>. Then we call the&nbsp;<code>addOne</code>&nbsp;function using the&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;variable as the argument and save the result to another variable called&nbsp;<code>anotherNumber</code>. Finally, we log to the console the values of both of our variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question is: what gets logged?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>10</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>11</code>, you are correct. Because numbers are passed by value, the value of&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;is passed to the function, but when the number is incremented, the&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;variable is unaffected.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Comparing Primitives</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we know that primitives are passed by value. But what about when they&rsquo;re compared? To answer that, let&rsquo;s look at another example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const x = 5;\r\nconst y = 5;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(x === y);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>We have two variables,&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>, both of which have the value&nbsp;<code>5</code>. When we log to the console a check for strict equality, what do we get?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>true</code>, you are correct. This is because&nbsp;<strong>primitives are compared by value</strong>&nbsp;too, and&nbsp;<code>5</code>&nbsp;is equal to&nbsp;<code>5</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Passing Objects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what about data types that are not primitives in JavaScript? For example,&nbsp;<code>objects</code>&nbsp;are not primitives, and neither are&nbsp;<code>arrays</code>&nbsp;(which are really just objects, secretly).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Objects are passed by reference.</strong>&nbsp;To understand what that means, let&rsquo;s look at a simple example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const someNumbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\n\r\nconst addNumberToArray = arr =&gt; {\r\n  arr.push(100);\r\n  return arr;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst otherNumbers = addNumberToArray(someNumbers);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(otherNumbers);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example we have a variable&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;which is an array that contains three elements. We have a function&nbsp;<code>addNumberToArray</code>&nbsp;that takes an argument (an array), pushes the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;into the array, and then returns the array. Then we call the&nbsp;<code>addNumberToArray</code>&nbsp;function using the&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;variable as the argument and save the result to another variable called&nbsp;<code>otherNumbers</code>. Finally, we log to the console the values of both of our variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question is: what gets logged?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>, you are correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh no! We&rsquo;ve inadvertently modified our input array that we passed to the function!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because objects are passed by reference, the reference to&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;is passed to the function. So, when the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;is pushed to the array, that value is being pushed into the same array that&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;represents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted to be sure not to modify the original array in a function like this, it would be necessary to push the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;into a copy of the input array using the&nbsp;<code>concat</code>&nbsp;method or the ES6&nbsp;<code>spread</code>&nbsp;operator. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const someNumbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\nconst addNumberToArray = arr =&gt; [...arr, 100];\r\nconst otherNumbers = addNumberToArray(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(otherNumbers);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now when we log those two variables to the console, we&rsquo;ll see&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>&nbsp;get logged. Much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Comparing Objects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we know that objects are passed by reference. But what about when they&rsquo;re compared? To answer that, let&rsquo;s look at another example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const object1 = { someKey: &#39;someValue&#39; }\r\nconst object2 = { someKey: &#39;someValue&#39; }</span></code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">\r\nconsole.log(object1 === object2);</span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>We have two variables,&nbsp;<code>object1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>object2</code>, both of which are an object with only one property. The key is&nbsp;<code>someKey</code>, and the value is&nbsp;<code>someValue</code>. When we log to the console a check for strict equality, what do we get?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>false</code>, you are correct. This is because&nbsp;<strong>objects are compared by reference</strong>&nbsp;too. Even though these two objects are the same in value, they are not the same object. These are two separate objects held in two separate variables, so their references are different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted a quick sanity check, you could also check if each object is equal to itself, like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">console.log(object1 === object1);\r\nconsole.log(object2 === object2);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of these logs to the console will be&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;since in each case you are comparing an object to itself, which is the same reference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you really wanted to check if&nbsp;<code>object1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>object2</code>&nbsp;had the same keys and values, you&rsquo;d need to write a utility method that would loop over the objects&rsquo; keys and values and make sure that they are all identical. Or, you could use a helper method from a library like&nbsp;<code>lodash</code>&nbsp;which implements this functionality for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Primitives are passed and compared by value.

This is because&nbsp;<strong>primitives are compared by value</strong>&nbsp;too, and&nbsp;<code>5</code>&nbsp;is equal to&nbsp;<code>5</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Passing Objects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what about data types that are not primitives in JavaScript? For example,&nbsp;<code>objects</code>&nbsp;are not primitives, and neither are&nbsp;<code>arrays</code>&nbsp;(which are really just objects, secretly).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Objects are passed by reference.</strong>&nbsp;To understand what that means, let&rsquo;s look at a simple example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const someNumbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\nconst addNumberToArray = arr =&gt; {\r\n  arr.push(100);\r\n  return arr;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst otherNumbers = addNumberToArray(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(otherNumbers);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example we have a variable&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;which is an array that contains three elements. We have a function&nbsp;<code>addNumberToArray</code>&nbsp;that takes an argument (an array), pushes the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;into the array, and then returns the array. Then we call the&nbsp;<code>addNumberToArray</code>&nbsp;function using the&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;variable as the argument and save the result to another variable called&nbsp;<code>otherNumbers</code>. Finally, we log to the console the values of both of our variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question is: what gets logged?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>, you are correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh no! We&rsquo;ve inadvertently modified our input array that we passed to the function!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because objects are passed by reference, the reference to&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;is passed to the function. So, when the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;is pushed to the array, that value is being pushed into the same array that&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;represents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted to be sure not to modify the original array in a function like this, it would be necessary to push the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;into a copy of the input array using the&nbsp;<code>concat</code>&nbsp;method or the ES6&nbsp;<code>spread</code>&nbsp;operator. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const someNumbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\nconst addNumberToArray = arr =&gt; [...arr, 100];\r\nconst otherNumbers = addNumberToArray(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(otherNumbers);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now when we log those two variables to the console, we&rsquo;ll see&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>&nbsp;get logged. Much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Comparing Objects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we know that objects are passed by reference. But what about when they&rsquo;re compared? To answer that, let&rsquo;s look at another example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const object1 = { someKey: &#39;someValue&#39; }\r\nconst object2 = { someKey: &#39;someValue&#39; }</span></code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">\r\nconsole.log(object1 === object2);</span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>We have two variables,&nbsp;<code>object1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>object2</code>, both of which are an object with only one property. The key is&nbsp;<code>someKey</code>, and the value is&nbsp;<code>someValue</code>. When we log to the console a check for strict equality, what do we get?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>false</code>, you are correct. This is because&nbsp;<strong>objects are compared by reference</strong>&nbsp;too. Even though these two objects are the same in value, they are not the same object. These are two separate objects held in two separate variables, so their references are different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted a quick sanity check, you could also check if each object is equal to itself, like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">console.log(object1 === object1);\r\nconsole.log(object2 === object2);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of these logs to the console will be&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;since in each case you are comparing an object to itself, which is the same reference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you really wanted to check if&nbsp;<code>object1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>object2</code>&nbsp;had the same keys and values, you&rsquo;d need to write a utility method that would loop over the objects&rsquo; keys and values and make sure that they are all identical. Or, you could use a helper method from a library like&nbsp;<code>lodash</code>&nbsp;which implements this functionality for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Primitives are passed and compared by value. Objects are passed and compared by reference. Understanding the difference will save you a lot of headaches debugging your code!</p>\r\n"], ["updated_at", "2020-05-27 11:40:40.923138"], ["id", 7]]

Learn Spring Framework (Spring Boot)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s almost imperative nowadays for a Java developer to learn Spring framework as most of the companies prefer to do development using Spring frameworks like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2017/11/top-5-free-core-spring-mvc-courses-learn-online.html\">Spring MVC</a>, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud for developing a web application, REST APIs Microservices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also promotes best practices like dependency injection and makes your application more testable which is a key requirement for modern-day software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a new Java developer then I suggest you to start with this Java and Spring tutorial to learn the basics of this awesome framework and if you are already familiar with Spring then you should explore Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for developing next-generation Java application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for some references, then&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru%2F\">Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru</a></strong>&nbsp;is the best course to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru%2F\"><img alt=\"Learn Spring Framework (Spring Boot) to become a better Java developer\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QGDlM9y9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jWRWuz5e9Jc/WvJKuBwCdeI/AAAAAAAALTw/iNZVhpsOzEAaXNsYVGtfvDvILioMfTmbwCLcBGAs/s640/Spring%252BBoot%252BCourse%252BUDemy.png\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Learn Unit Testing (JUnit and Mockito)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one common thing which separates a good Java developer from an average Java developer then its the unit testing skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good and professional Java developer almost always write unit tests for his code and if he is really&nbsp;<strong>a Rockstar developer</strong>&nbsp;you can see that from his code and tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing has also come a long way now with several tools for unit testing, integration testing and automation testing available to Java developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can spend a good amount of 2020 to hone your testing skill in Java but those who are new to Java world and unit testing, JUnit is the best library to start with.

Learn APIs and Libraries</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have worked with great Java developers you might have noticed their overall knowledge of Java Ecosystem and APIs forms a major part of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Java is the world&#39;s most popular and mature programing language and there are tons of libraries and APIs available for doing almost everything possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you are not expected to know all of them but you should be familiar with some key APIs like JSON processing APIs like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/10/jackson-json-parsing-error.html\">Jackson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/10/3-ways-to-convert-string-to-json-object-in-java.html\">Gson</a>, XML processing APIs like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/01/jaxb-xml-binding-tutorial-marshalling-unmarshalling-java-object-xml.html\">JAXB</a>&nbsp;and Xerces, Unit testing libraries like Mockito and JUnit etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&#39;t know them you can learn or at least get an overview of them in 2020. To start with you can check out my list of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-20-libraries-and-apis-for-java-programmers.html\">20 Java libraries every Java developer should know</a>, which covers libraries from key areas like parsing, bytecode manipulation, concurrency, collections etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2018/02/top-10-open-source-frameworks-and-libraries-java-web-developers.html\"><img alt=\"4.

Learn JVM Internals</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are serious about becoming a Rockstar Java Developer then you must spend the time to learn JVM internals e.g. what are different parts of JVM, how they work,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2013/02/difference-between-jit-and-jvm-in-java.html\">JIT</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/08/10-jvm-options-for-java-production-application.html\">JVM options</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/04/garbage-collection-in-java.html\">Garbage collections</a>, and collectors etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you know JVM well you can write both robust and high-performance Java application and that&#39;s what Rockstar Java developers do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of this, you should also learn how to profile your Java application, how to find&nbsp;<strong>performance bottlenecks</strong>&nbsp;e.g. which objects are taking most of your memories and eating CPUs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For structured learning, I recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Funderstanding-java-vm-memory-management\"><strong>Understanding the Java Virtual Machine series</strong></a>&nbsp;on Pluralsight.

Learn Design Patterns</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are writing a Java application from scratch then most of the time you are writing object-oriented code and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-java-design-pattern-courses-for-developers.html\">design patterns</a>&nbsp;are tried and tested solution of common problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By knowing and incorporating them into your code you make your application more flexible and easier to change in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also improves overall code quality and documentation because other Java developers are also familiar with design patterns and they will understand your solution rather quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, don&#39;t just focus on code part, understand the spirit and be creative. Use Java 8 features like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/02/10-example-of-lambda-expressions-in-java8.html\">lambdas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2014/04/java-8-stream-examples-and-tutorial.html\">Streams</a>&nbsp;to rewrite patterns like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/07/strategy-design-pattern-and-open-closed-principle-java-example.html\">Strategy patterns</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fexperience-design-patterns%2F\"><img alt=\"6.

Learn Kotlin</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of years of back I read a book called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1617290068/?tag=javamysqlanta-20\">The Well-Grounded Java Developer</a>&nbsp;which highlighted the advantage of becoming a Polyglot programmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It inspired me to learn&nbsp;<strong>Scala</strong>&nbsp;and later I also tried&nbsp;<strong>Groovy</strong>&nbsp;because of its increased usage in creating build scripts and unit testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That experience has helped me a lot and that&#39;s why I encourage Java developers to learn a new JVM language. I have blogged about it previously on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-3-jvm-languages-java-programmer-learn.html\">3 JVM languages Java developers should learn in 2020</a>&nbsp;but if you are in hurry, just Learn Kotlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a great language from JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA and also official language for Android development as announced by Google in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will not only improve your productivity but also help you to go into Android development area. If you are looking to learn Kotlin in 2020 and looking for some good resource then here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/5-courses-to-learn-kotlin-programming-java-android.html\">list of Kotlin courses</a>&nbsp;to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fkotlin-for-java-developers%2F\"><img alt=\"8.

Learn Your IDE Better</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important traits of better Java developers is that they are very good on their tools. They not only know more tools than an average developer but also they know their tools well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA are a most important tool for a Java programmer, it makes sense to spend some time to learn better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can learn about some plugins which make your task easy or some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2010/10/eclipse-tutorial-most-useful-eclipse.html\">keyboard shortcuts</a>&nbsp;which helps you to navigate better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html\"><img alt=\"Java tips 10 - Learn Your IDE Better\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MSlfijMw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-suYxob7S4LU/WvJLQr6OdHI/AAAAAAAALT8/lqp3KMDWcE0alJSeZDVKJRdgavVLb5HkQCEwYBhgL/s640/Eclipse%252BShortcut%252Bfor%252BJava%252BProgrammers.jpg\" /></a>\\<br />\r\nEven some small tips help a long way because you use them a lot more than you think.

Learn Java Better</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the most important thing for a Java developer right now. Java is constantly updated and now with every new version in 6 months, it&#39;s a big challenge to keep yourself up-to-date. I have been learning&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/03/java-10-released-10-new-features-java.html\">Java 10 features</a>&nbsp;and I know many programmers who have not written a single line of code using Java 8 features like lambdas and Stream API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, most of them are experienced Java developer with good 7 to 10 years of experience in their belt. I understand that at some point in your career learning becomes slow but if you don&#39;t act now you will be left behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all Java development job now required Java 8+ skills and if you don&#39;t have them, it would be very difficult to do well and perform well in your Java interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you have made your mind to learn Java but worry about where to start with, I suggest you check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F\"><strong>The Complete Java MasterClass</strong></a>&nbsp;on Udemy, which will teach you all the basics of Java 8 features and other new features introduced in Java 9, 10, 11 and maybe in Java 12 very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F\"><img alt=\"10 Tips to Become a Better Java Developer in 2020- Learn Java 13\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YR4LNAEP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYrji__rQog/WvJKmRGGFII/AAAAAAAALTs/z59bvZLv51Y-J4D3Qi6BSUCILtGBGjWYACLcBGAs/s640/Java%252B8%252BComparator%252Bexample.png\" /></a>\\<br />\r\nAnd, if you are interested in more advanced, hands-on course then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learning.javaspecialists.eu/courses/refactoring2j8?affcode=92815_johrd7r8\">Refactoring Java 8</a>&nbsp;by Dr. Heinz Kabutz is a good one to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s all about some of my&nbsp;<strong>tips to become a better Java developer in 2020</strong>. I know it&#39;s difficult to follow all these tips and I am not asking to do that, it&#39;s simply not practical.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>You can focus on more important first e.g. Learning Java 8 and Learning Spring Framework if you haven&#39;t known them yet but if you are good at those than you can pick other topics e.g. unit testing, JVM internals, and DevOps.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>To start with you need to pick one like learning latest Java featues since Java 8 to Java 13 and commit with that before moving to next tip. If you are looking for some low hanging fruits then learning your IDE better is a good choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You already know your IDE and spending some time to learn it better will make you more productive and better Java developer in quick time.</p>\r\n", "post_tags"=>"java, iLoveJava"}, "commit"=>"Save"}

Learn Spring Framework (Spring Boot)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s almost imperative nowadays for a Java developer to learn Spring framework as most of the companies prefer to do development using Spring frameworks like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2017/11/top-5-free-core-spring-mvc-courses-learn-online.html\">Spring MVC</a>, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud for developing a web application, REST APIs Microservices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also promotes best practices like dependency injection and makes your application more testable which is a key requirement for modern-day software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a new Java developer then I suggest you to start with this Java and Spring tutorial to learn the basics of this awesome framework and if you are already familiar with Spring then you should explore Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for developing next-generation Java application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for some references, then&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru%2F\">Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru</a></strong>&nbsp;is the best course to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru%2F\"><img alt=\"Learn Spring Framework (Spring Boot) to become a better Java developer\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QGDlM9y9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jWRWuz5e9Jc/WvJKuBwCdeI/AAAAAAAALTw/iNZVhpsOzEAaXNsYVGtfvDvILioMfTmbwCLcBGAs/s640/Spring%252BBoot%252BCourse%252BUDemy.png\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Learn Unit Testing (JUnit and Mockito)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one common thing which separates a good Java developer from an average Java developer then its the unit testing skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good and professional Java developer almost always write unit tests for his code and if he is really&nbsp;<strong>a Rockstar developer</strong>&nbsp;you can see that from his code and tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing has also come a long way now with several tools for unit testing, integration testing and automation testing available to Java developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can spend a good amount of 2020 to hone your testing skill in Java but those who are new to Java world and unit testing, JUnit is the best library to start with. The recent version JUnit 5 is both powerful and flexible and every Java developer should know that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for a good overview of JUnit and unit testing in Java then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjunitandmockitocrashcourse%2F\"><strong>JUnit and Mockito Crash Course</strong></a>s a perfect to start with.

Learn APIs and Libraries</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have worked with great Java developers you might have noticed their overall knowledge of Java Ecosystem and APIs forms a major part of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Java is the world&#39;s most popular and mature programing language and there are tons of libraries and APIs available for doing almost everything possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you are not expected to know all of them but you should be familiar with some key APIs like JSON processing APIs like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/10/jackson-json-parsing-error.html\">Jackson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/10/3-ways-to-convert-string-to-json-object-in-java.html\">Gson</a>, XML processing APIs like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/01/jaxb-xml-binding-tutorial-marshalling-unmarshalling-java-object-xml.html\">JAXB</a>&nbsp;and Xerces, Unit testing libraries like Mockito and JUnit etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&#39;t know them you can learn or at least get an overview of them in 2020. To start with you can check out my list of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-20-libraries-and-apis-for-java-programmers.html\">20 Java libraries every Java developer should know</a>, which covers libraries from key areas like parsing, bytecode manipulation, concurrency, collections etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2018/02/top-10-open-source-frameworks-and-libraries-java-web-developers.html\"><img alt=\"4.

Learn JVM Internals</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are serious about becoming a Rockstar Java Developer then you must spend the time to learn JVM internals e.g. what are different parts of JVM, how they work,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2013/02/difference-between-jit-and-jvm-in-java.html\">JIT</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/08/10-jvm-options-for-java-production-application.html\">JVM options</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/04/garbage-collection-in-java.html\">Garbage collections</a>, and collectors etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you know JVM well you can write both robust and high-performance Java application and that&#39;s what Rockstar Java developers do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of this, you should also learn how to profile your Java application, how to find&nbsp;<strong>performance bottlenecks</strong>&nbsp;e.g. which objects are taking most of your memories and eating CPUs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For structured learning, I recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Funderstanding-java-vm-memory-management\"><strong>Understanding the Java Virtual Machine series</strong></a>&nbsp;on Pluralsight.

Learn Design Patterns</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are writing a Java application from scratch then most of the time you are writing object-oriented code and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-java-design-pattern-courses-for-developers.html\">design patterns</a>&nbsp;are tried and tested solution of common problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By knowing and incorporating them into your code you make your application more flexible and easier to change in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also improves overall code quality and documentation because other Java developers are also familiar with design patterns and they will understand your solution rather quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, don&#39;t just focus on code part, understand the spirit and be creative. Use Java 8 features like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/02/10-example-of-lambda-expressions-in-java8.html\">lambdas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2014/04/java-8-stream-examples-and-tutorial.html\">Streams</a>&nbsp;to rewrite patterns like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/07/strategy-design-pattern-and-open-closed-principle-java-example.html\">Strategy patterns</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fexperience-design-patterns%2F\"><img alt=\"6.

And, for those who like books, my recommended books on design patterns can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/10/top-5-object-oriented-analysis-and-design-patterns-book-java.html\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>8. Learn Kotlin</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of years of back I read a book called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1617290068/?tag=javamysqlanta-20\">The Well-Grounded Java Developer</a>&nbsp;which highlighted the advantage of becoming a Polyglot programmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It inspired me to learn&nbsp;<strong>Scala</strong>&nbsp;and later I also tried&nbsp;<strong>Groovy</strong>&nbsp;because of its increased usage in creating build scripts and unit testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That experience has helped me a lot and that&#39;s why I encourage Java developers to learn a new JVM language. I have blogged about it previously on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-3-jvm-languages-java-programmer-learn.html\">3 JVM languages Java developers should learn in 2020</a>&nbsp;but if you are in hurry, just Learn Kotlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a great language from JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA and also official language for Android development as announced by Google in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will not only improve your productivity but also help you to go into Android development area. If you are looking to learn Kotlin in 2020 and looking for some good resource then here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/5-courses-to-learn-kotlin-programming-java-android.html\">list of Kotlin courses</a>&nbsp;to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fkotlin-for-java-developers%2F\"><img alt=\"8.

Learn Microservices</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Architecture is changing constantly and many companies are moving from monolithic application to microservices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s high time for Java developers to learn&nbsp;<strong>Microservice architecture</strong>&nbsp;and how to create Microservices in Java to take advantage of this recent wave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, Spring framework provides&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/04/top-5-spring-cloud-courses-for-java.html#axzz5DbV6r2Ll\">Spring Cloud</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2017/11/top-5-free-core-spring-mvc-courses-learn-online.html\">Spring Boot</a>&nbsp;which greatly simplify microservice development in Java.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for course then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fmicroservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud%2F\"><strong>Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud</strong></a>&nbsp;is a good one to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fmicroservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud%2F\"><img alt=\"tips to become a better Java developer - 9.

Learn Your IDE Better</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important traits of better Java developers is that they are very good on their tools. They not only know more tools than an average developer but also they know their tools well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA are a most important tool for a Java programmer, it makes sense to spend some time to learn better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can learn about some plugins which make your task easy or some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2010/10/eclipse-tutorial-most-useful-eclipse.html\">keyboard shortcuts</a>&nbsp;which helps you to navigate better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html\"><img alt=\"Java tips 10 - Learn Your IDE Better\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MSlfijMw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-suYxob7S4LU/WvJLQr6OdHI/AAAAAAAALT8/lqp3KMDWcE0alJSeZDVKJRdgavVLb5HkQCEwYBhgL/s640/Eclipse%252BShortcut%252Bfor%252BJava%252BProgrammers.jpg\" /></a>\\<br />\r\nEven some small tips help a long way because you use them a lot more than you think. If you are serious about taking your IDE skills to next level and use Eclipse, then I suggest you check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Feclipse-debugging-techniques-and-tricks%2F\"><strong>Eclipse Debugging Techniques And Tricks</strong></a>&nbsp;on Udemy, a perfect course to improve your knowledge of Eclipse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>11. Learn Java Better</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the most important thing for a Java developer right now. Java is constantly updated and now with every new version in 6 months, it&#39;s a big challenge to keep yourself up-to-date. I have been learning&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/03/java-10-released-10-new-features-java.html\">Java 10 features</a>&nbsp;and I know many programmers who have not written a single line of code using Java 8 features like lambdas and Stream API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, most of them are experienced Java developer with good 7 to 10 years of experience in their belt. I understand that at some point in your career learning becomes slow but if you don&#39;t act now you will be left behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all Java development job now required Java 8+ skills and if you don&#39;t have them, it would be very difficult to do well and perform well in your Java interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you have made your mind to learn Java but worry about where to start with, I suggest you check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F\"><strong>The Complete Java MasterClass</strong></a>&nbsp;on Udemy, which will teach you all the basics of Java 8 features and other new features introduced in Java 9, 10, 11 and maybe in Java 12 very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F\"><img alt=\"10 Tips to Become a Better Java Developer in 2020- Learn Java 13\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YR4LNAEP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYrji__rQog/WvJKmRGGFII/AAAAAAAALTs/z59bvZLv51Y-J4D3Qi6BSUCILtGBGjWYACLcBGAs/s640/Java%252B8%252BComparator%252Bexample.png\" /></a>\\<br />\r\nAnd, if you are interested in more advanced, hands-on course then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learning.javaspecialists.eu/courses/refactoring2j8?affcode=92815_johrd7r8\">Refactoring Java 8</a>&nbsp;by Dr. Heinz Kabutz is a good one to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s all about some of my&nbsp;<strong>tips to become a better Java developer in 2020</strong>. I know it&#39;s difficult to follow all these tips and I am not asking to do that, it&#39;s simply not practical.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>You can focus on more important first e.g. Learning Java 8 and Learning Spring Framework if you haven&#39;t known them yet but if you are good at those than you can pick other topics e.g. unit testing, JVM internals, and DevOps.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>To start with you need to pick one like learning latest Java featues since Java 8 to Java 13 and commit with that before moving to next tip. If you are looking for some low hanging fruits then learning your IDE better is a good choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You already know your IDE and spending some time to learn it better will make you more productive and better Java developer in quick time.</p>\r\n"], ["user_id", 2], ["created_at", "2020-05-27 11:43:11.656375"], ["updated_at", "2020-05-27 11:43:11.656375"]]

You&#39;re giving them one less thing they have to worry about.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Do You Talk About?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some you might be thinking what can you talk about you&#39;re a noob speaking to professionals, There are two approaches you can take. I took both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, you can talk about new and hot technologies or tools. I gave a talk on a new framework called Svelte at a JavaScript Meetup. Not a lot of people knew about it and I was able to add something new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was asked questions that I didn&#39;t know the answer to. I answered that I didn&#39;t know but that actually helped me make my talk better for the next time. I can add info about those questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, you can do &quot;soft skills&quot; talks that aren&#39;t tech-specific but can benefit developers. I did a talk on &quot;Personal Branding for Developers&quot; and a talk on &quot;How to Use Social Media to Boost Your Job Search&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can do talks on your learning techniques, bootcamp journey, what you learned from applying to 100 jobs. This list is endless because they come from your experience and no one can tell you your experience is wrong because it&#39;s yours and yours alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking at meetups lets people come to you. Afterward, people will ask you questions about resources, you&#39;re background etc. Now you get a chance to craft a story and build new relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From speaking at meetups people have approached me months later saying they enjoyed my talk and how it helped them. I even got reached out to be on a podcast from someone who was in the audience at my Svelte talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This also strengthens relationships with people you already have met on your journey. When people see you really exceeding your comfort zone they start to gain a deep appreciation for what you&#39;re doing and will find ways to support you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What If Nobody Likes My Talk or Don&#39;t Do A Good Job?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s definitely not a possibility! I thought every talk I gave sucked and I was being exposed as a fraud but the feedback I got was quite the opposite. I was told &quot;I really enjoyed that you didn&#39;t talk like a walking computer&quot; and one bootcamp student said &quot;Thank you, your made me realize I can be a developer, you made it seem so easy.&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So your viewpoint might be just what someone in the audience needs. You never know who out there is watching and waiting for your perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So go out there and show the world what you know. I looked forward to seeing it.</p>\r\n", "post_tags"=>"#webdev, #codenewbie"}, "commit"=>"Save", "id"=>"6"}

This is a concept that often causes new developers to stumble when first learning JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIn this article we’ll look at a few examples to better understand how variables are treated and what the difference is between “reference” and “value”.", "body"=>"<h2>Passing Primitives</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Primitive data types in JavaScript are things like&nbsp;<code>number</code>,&nbsp;<code>string</code>,&nbsp;<code>boolean</code>, or&nbsp;<code>undefined</code>. There are other primitives, but those are the most common ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Primitives are passed by value.</strong>&nbsp;To understand what that means, let&rsquo;s look at a simple example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const myNumber = 10;\r\nconst addOne = x =&gt; x + 1;\r\nconst anotherNumber = addOne(myNumber);\r\nconsole.log(myNumber);\r\nconsole.log(anotherNumber);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example we have a variable&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;which has the value&nbsp;<code>10</code>. We have a function&nbsp;<code>addOne</code>&nbsp;that takes an argument and returns the argument plus&nbsp;<code>1</code>. Then we call the&nbsp;<code>addOne</code>&nbsp;function using the&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;variable as the argument and save the result to another variable called&nbsp;<code>anotherNumber</code>. Finally, we log to the console the values of both of our variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question is: what gets logged?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>10</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>11</code>, you are correct. Because numbers are passed by value, the value of&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;is passed to the function, but when the number is incremented, the&nbsp;<code>myNumber</code>&nbsp;variable is unaffected.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Comparing Primitives</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we know that primitives are passed by value. But what about when they&rsquo;re compared? To answer that, let&rsquo;s look at another example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const x = 5;\r\nconst y = 5;\r\nconsole.log(x === y);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>We have two variables,&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>, both of which have the value&nbsp;<code>5</code>. When we log to the console a check for strict equality, what do we get?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>true</code>, you are correct. This is because&nbsp;<strong>primitives are compared by value</strong>&nbsp;too, and&nbsp;<code>5</code>&nbsp;is equal to&nbsp;<code>5</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Passing Objects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what about data types that are not primitives in JavaScript? For example,&nbsp;<code>objects</code>&nbsp;are not primitives, and neither are&nbsp;<code>arrays</code>&nbsp;(which are really just objects, secretly).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Objects are passed by reference.</strong>&nbsp;To understand what that means, let&rsquo;s look at a simple example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const someNumbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\nconst addNumberToArray = arr =&gt; {\r\n  arr.push(100);\r\n  return arr;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst otherNumbers = addNumberToArray(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(otherNumbers);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example we have a variable&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;which is an array that contains three elements. We have a function&nbsp;<code>addNumberToArray</code>&nbsp;that takes an argument (an array), pushes the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;into the array, and then returns the array. Then we call the&nbsp;<code>addNumberToArray</code>&nbsp;function using the&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;variable as the argument and save the result to another variable called&nbsp;<code>otherNumbers</code>. Finally, we log to the console the values of both of our variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question is: what gets logged?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>, you are correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh no! We&rsquo;ve inadvertently modified our input array that we passed to the function!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because objects are passed by reference, the reference to&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;is passed to the function. So, when the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;is pushed to the array, that value is being pushed into the same array that&nbsp;<code>someNumbers</code>&nbsp;represents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted to be sure not to modify the original array in a function like this, it would be necessary to push the value&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;into a copy of the input array using the&nbsp;<code>concat</code>&nbsp;method or the ES6&nbsp;<code>spread</code>&nbsp;operator. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const someNumbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\nconst addNumberToArray = arr =&gt; [...arr, 100];\r\nconst otherNumbers = addNumberToArray(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(someNumbers);\r\nconsole.log(otherNumbers);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now when we log those two variables to the console, we&rsquo;ll see&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, 3, 100]</code>&nbsp;get logged. Much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Comparing Objects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we know that objects are passed by reference. But what about when they&rsquo;re compared? To answer that, let&rsquo;s look at another example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">const object1 = { someKey: &#39;someValue&#39; }\r\nconst object2 = { someKey: &#39;someValue&#39; }</span></code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">\r\nconsole.log(object1 === object2);</span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>We have two variables,&nbsp;<code>object1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>object2</code>, both of which are an object with only one property. The key is&nbsp;<code>someKey</code>, and the value is&nbsp;<code>someValue</code>. When we log to the console a check for strict equality, what do we get?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answered&nbsp;<code>false</code>, you are correct. This is because&nbsp;<strong>objects are compared by reference</strong>&nbsp;too. Even though these two objects are the same in value, they are not the same object. These are two separate objects held in two separate variables, so their references are different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted a quick sanity check, you could also check if each object is equal to itself, like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><code><span style=\"background-color:#2c3e50;\">console.log(object1 === object1);\r\nconsole.log(object2 === object2);\r\n</span></code></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of these logs to the console will be&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;since in each case you are comparing an object to itself, which is the same reference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you really wanted to check if&nbsp;<code>object1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>object2</code>&nbsp;had the same keys and values, you&rsquo;d need to write a utility method that would loop over the objects&rsquo; keys and values and make sure that they are all identical. Or, you could use a helper method from a library like&nbsp;<code>lodash</code>&nbsp;which implements this functionality for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Primitives are passed and compared by value. Objects are passed and compared by reference. Understanding the difference will save you a lot of headaches debugging your code!</p>\r\n", "post_tags"=>"#javascript, #beginners, #webdev"}, "commit"=>"Save", "id"=>"7"}

Learn Spring Framework (Spring Boot)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s almost imperative nowadays for a Java developer to learn Spring framework as most of the companies prefer to do development using Spring frameworks like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2017/11/top-5-free-core-spring-mvc-courses-learn-online.html\">Spring MVC</a>, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud for developing a web application, REST APIs Microservices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also promotes best practices like dependency injection and makes your application more testable which is a key requirement for modern-day software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a new Java developer then I suggest you to start with this Java and Spring tutorial to learn the basics of this awesome framework and if you are already familiar with Spring then you should explore Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for developing next-generation Java application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for some references, then&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru%2F\">Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru</a></strong>&nbsp;is the best course to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fspring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru%2F\"><img alt=\"Learn Spring Framework (Spring Boot) to become a better Java developer\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QGDlM9y9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jWRWuz5e9Jc/WvJKuBwCdeI/AAAAAAAALTw/iNZVhpsOzEAaXNsYVGtfvDvILioMfTmbwCLcBGAs/s640/Spring%252BBoot%252BCourse%252BUDemy.png\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Learn Unit Testing (JUnit and Mockito)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one common thing which separates a good Java developer from an average Java developer then its the unit testing skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good and professional Java developer almost always write unit tests for his code and if he is really&nbsp;<strong>a Rockstar developer</strong>&nbsp;you can see that from his code and tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing has also come a long way now with several tools for unit testing, integration testing and automation testing available to Java developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can spend a good amount of 2020 to hone your testing skill in Java but those who are new to Java world and unit testing, JUnit is the best library to start with. The recent version JUnit 5 is both powerful and flexible and every Java developer should know that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for a good overview of JUnit and unit testing in Java then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjunitandmockitocrashcourse%2F\"><strong>JUnit and Mockito Crash Course</strong></a>s a perfect to start with.

Learn APIs and Libraries</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have worked with great Java developers you might have noticed their overall knowledge of Java Ecosystem and APIs forms a major part of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Java is the world&#39;s most popular and mature programing language and there are tons of libraries and APIs available for doing almost everything possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you are not expected to know all of them but you should be familiar with some key APIs like JSON processing APIs like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/10/jackson-json-parsing-error.html\">Jackson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/10/3-ways-to-convert-string-to-json-object-in-java.html\">Gson</a>, XML processing APIs like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/01/jaxb-xml-binding-tutorial-marshalling-unmarshalling-java-object-xml.html\">JAXB</a>&nbsp;and Xerces, Unit testing libraries like Mockito and JUnit etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&#39;t know them you can learn or at least get an overview of them in 2020. To start with you can check out my list of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-20-libraries-and-apis-for-java-programmers.html\">20 Java libraries every Java developer should know</a>, which covers libraries from key areas like parsing, bytecode manipulation, concurrency, collections etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2018/02/top-10-open-source-frameworks-and-libraries-java-web-developers.html\"><img alt=\"4.

Learn JVM Internals</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are serious about becoming a Rockstar Java Developer then you must spend the time to learn JVM internals e.g. what are different parts of JVM, how they work,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2013/02/difference-between-jit-and-jvm-in-java.html\">JIT</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/08/10-jvm-options-for-java-production-application.html\">JVM options</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/04/garbage-collection-in-java.html\">Garbage collections</a>, and collectors etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you know JVM well you can write both robust and high-performance Java application and that&#39;s what Rockstar Java developers do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of this, you should also learn how to profile your Java application, how to find&nbsp;<strong>performance bottlenecks</strong>&nbsp;e.g. which objects are taking most of your memories and eating CPUs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For structured learning, I recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Funderstanding-java-vm-memory-management\"><strong>Understanding the Java Virtual Machine series</strong></a>&nbsp;on Pluralsight.

Learn Design Patterns</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are writing a Java application from scratch then most of the time you are writing object-oriented code and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-java-design-pattern-courses-for-developers.html\">design patterns</a>&nbsp;are tried and tested solution of common problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By knowing and incorporating them into your code you make your application more flexible and easier to change in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also improves overall code quality and documentation because other Java developers are also familiar with design patterns and they will understand your solution rather quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, don&#39;t just focus on code part, understand the spirit and be creative. Use Java 8 features like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/02/10-example-of-lambda-expressions-in-java8.html\">lambdas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2014/04/java-8-stream-examples-and-tutorial.html\">Streams</a>&nbsp;to rewrite patterns like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/07/strategy-design-pattern-and-open-closed-principle-java-example.html\">Strategy patterns</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fexperience-design-patterns%2F\"><img alt=\"6.

And, for those who like books, my recommended books on design patterns can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/10/top-5-object-oriented-analysis-and-design-patterns-book-java.html\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>8. Learn Kotlin</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of years of back I read a book called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1617290068/?tag=javamysqlanta-20\">The Well-Grounded Java Developer</a>&nbsp;which highlighted the advantage of becoming a Polyglot programmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It inspired me to learn&nbsp;<strong>Scala</strong>&nbsp;and later I also tried&nbsp;<strong>Groovy</strong>&nbsp;because of its increased usage in creating build scripts and unit testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That experience has helped me a lot and that&#39;s why I encourage Java developers to learn a new JVM language. I have blogged about it previously on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-3-jvm-languages-java-programmer-learn.html\">3 JVM languages Java developers should learn in 2020</a>&nbsp;but if you are in hurry, just Learn Kotlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a great language from JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA and also official language for Android development as announced by Google in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will not only improve your productivity but also help you to go into Android development area. If you are looking to learn Kotlin in 2020 and looking for some good resource then here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/5-courses-to-learn-kotlin-programming-java-android.html\">list of Kotlin courses</a>&nbsp;to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=562016.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fkotlin-for-java-developers%2F\"><img alt=\"8.

Learn Microservices</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Architecture is changing constantly and many companies are moving from monolithic application to microservices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s high time for Java developers to learn&nbsp;<strong>Microservice architecture</strong>&nbsp;and how to create Microservices in Java to take advantage of this recent wave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, Spring framework provides&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/04/top-5-spring-cloud-courses-for-java.html#axzz5DbV6r2Ll\">Spring Cloud</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2017/11/top-5-free-core-spring-mvc-courses-learn-online.html\">Spring Boot</a>&nbsp;which greatly simplify microservice development in Java.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for course then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fmicroservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud%2F\"><strong>Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud</strong></a>&nbsp;is a good one to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fmicroservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud%2F\"><img alt=\"tips to become a better Java developer - 9.

Learn Your IDE Better</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important traits of better Java developers is that they are very good on their tools. They not only know more tools than an average developer but also they know their tools well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA are a most important tool for a Java programmer, it makes sense to spend some time to learn better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can learn about some plugins which make your task easy or some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2010/10/eclipse-tutorial-most-useful-eclipse.html\">keyboard shortcuts</a>&nbsp;which helps you to navigate better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html\"><img alt=\"Java tips 10 - Learn Your IDE Better\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MSlfijMw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-suYxob7S4LU/WvJLQr6OdHI/AAAAAAAALT8/lqp3KMDWcE0alJSeZDVKJRdgavVLb5HkQCEwYBhgL/s640/Eclipse%252BShortcut%252Bfor%252BJava%252BProgrammers.jpg\" /></a>\\<br />\r\nEven some small tips help a long way because you use them a lot more than you think. If you are serious about taking your IDE skills to next level and use Eclipse, then I suggest you check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Feclipse-debugging-techniques-and-tricks%2F\"><strong>Eclipse Debugging Techniques And Tricks</strong></a>&nbsp;on Udemy, a perfect course to improve your knowledge of Eclipse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>11. Learn Java Better</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the most important thing for a Java developer right now. Java is constantly updated and now with every new version in 6 months, it&#39;s a big challenge to keep yourself up-to-date. I have been learning&nbsp;<a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/03/java-10-released-10-new-features-java.html\">Java 10 features</a>&nbsp;and I know many programmers who have not written a single line of code using Java 8 features like lambdas and Stream API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, most of them are experienced Java developer with good 7 to 10 years of experience in their belt. I understand that at some point in your career learning becomes slow but if you don&#39;t act now you will be left behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all Java development job now required Java 8+ skills and if you don&#39;t have them, it would be very difficult to do well and perform well in your Java interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you have made your mind to learn Java but worry about where to start with, I suggest you check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F\"><strong>The Complete Java MasterClass</strong></a>&nbsp;on Udemy, which will teach you all the basics of Java 8 features and other new features introduced in Java 9, 10, 11 and maybe in Java 12 very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F\"><img alt=\"10 Tips to Become a Better Java Developer in 2020- Learn Java 13\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YR4LNAEP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYrji__rQog/WvJKmRGGFII/AAAAAAAALTs/z59bvZLv51Y-J4D3Qi6BSUCILtGBGjWYACLcBGAs/s640/Java%252B8%252BComparator%252Bexample.png\" /></a>\\<br />\r\nAnd, if you are interested in more advanced, hands-on course then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learning.javaspecialists.eu/courses/refactoring2j8?affcode=92815_johrd7r8\">Refactoring Java 8</a>&nbsp;by Dr. Heinz Kabutz is a good one to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s all about some of my&nbsp;<strong>tips to become a better Java developer in 2020</strong>. I know it&#39;s difficult to follow all these tips and I am not asking to do that, it&#39;s simply not practical.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>You can focus on more important first e.g. Learning Java 8 and Learning Spring Framework if you haven&#39;t known them yet but if you are good at those than you can pick other topics e.g. unit testing, JVM internals, and DevOps.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>To start with you need to pick one like learning latest Java featues since Java 8 to Java 13 and commit with that before moving to next tip. If you are looking for some low hanging fruits then learning your IDE better is a good choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You already know your IDE and spending some time to learn it better will make you more productive and better Java developer in quick time.</p>\r\n", "post_tags"=>"#java, #iLoveJava"}, "commit"=>"Save", "id"=>"8"}
